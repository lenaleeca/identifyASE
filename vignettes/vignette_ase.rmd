## Background

Sepsis, a clinical syndrome of “life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection” is estimated to affect 49 million people annually, causing 20% of all worldwide deaths. Despite its critical public health importance, sepsis identification remains a challenge. 

The **Adult Sepsis Event (ASE) Toolkit** developed by the **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** , provides a standardized framework for sepsis surveillance by leveraging electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithms. This toolkit is designed to enhance the consistency of sepsis identification and reporting, thereby enabling healthcare institutions to monitor trends, assess interventions, and improve care delivery. It identifies ASE based on the following criteria:

- **Presumed serious infection**: Blood culture collection and at least 4 consecutive days of qualifying antimicrobial treatment.  

- **Acute organ dysfunction**:  Initiation of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, changes in biomarkers such as serum creatinine, total bilirubin, serum lactate, platelet counts.

For more detailed information, refer to the [CDC Hospital Toolkit for Adult Sepsis Surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/pdfs/sepsis-surveillance-toolkit-mar-2018_508.pdf).

## `identifyASE` Package

The `identifyASE` package follows a hierarchical structure modelled on the ASE toolkit’s criteria to identify ASE in hospitalized patients. The `define_ase` function sits at the top of the hierarchical structure of the package and is the main function users will interact with. This function initiates the analysis by sequentially executing key functions to check the ASE criteria. The first criterion, presumed infection, is checked by identifying blood culture events through `slice_bcx_data` and qualifying antimicrobial medications through `qualifying_abx_duration`. The second criterion, acute organ dysfunction, is evaluated using `add_aod_daily`. These key functions are supported by helper functions at a lower level, which handle specific data transformations and calculations.

## Input Data

The input data for this package consists of a dataset containing daily patient-level information during hospitalization. The dataset should include variables such as unique patient and hospitalization identifiers, daily clinical variables (blood culture collection, use of vasopressor and invasive mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial treatments), and laboratory measurements. The data should be sorted within each patient chronologically by the admission date and hospital calendar day. The following table detailed the required variables:

### Handling Large Integer Variables 

In some datasets, variables like `seqnum` or `unique_pt_id` may be stored as **integer64** instead of standard integer or numeric types. This can occur in the following situations:

- **Large Integers**: When your data includes integer values exceeding the 32-bit integer limit (`2^31 - 1`), such as large IDs or timestamps.  
- **Memory Efficiency**: When you need to efficiently store and manipulate large vectors of integer data without converting them to double precision, which can lose exact integer representation.
- **Interfacing with external data**: When importing data from sources or systems (like databases) that use 64-bit integers, ensuring data integrity when importing/exporting values.

In such cases, please install and load the `bit64` package before running the define_ase function. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("bit64")
library(bit64)
```


## Key Functions 

### `slice_bcx_data`
This function identifies all blood culture events for each patient and creates rolling BCWPs around each event. The BCWPs are stored in a list, with each BCWP spans two days before and six days after the blood culture date or until discharge/death, capturing relevant data for independent analysis. The six-day post-blood culture period is derived from the original two-day BCWP interval (i.e., +2 days) plus four additional days to track sequential antimicrobial usage if a new antimicrobial starts on the final BCWP day.

### `qualifying_abx_duration`
This function identifies whether an antimicrobial treatment qualifies within the context of presumed infection in the ASE toolkit. It first detects the initiation of a new antimicrobial treatment in a window period surrounding a blood culture and calculates the run length of consecutive antibiotic days. The function then evaluates whether the antibiotic duration meets predefined qualifying criteria outlined in the toolkit, which includes a minimum duration of four consecutive days in the absence of death, transfer or discharge. It ensures that events such as death or acute transfer during the window period were properly evaluated within the BCWPs by allowing antimicrobial treatment to qualify for the presumed infection criteria even with fewer than four consecutive QADs, provided treatment continued up to the day of death or transfer, or one day prior. 

### `add_aod_daily`
This function processes each BCWP and identifies presence of acute organ dysfunction, based on initiation of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, changes in biomarkers such as serum creatinine, total bilirubin, serum lactate, platelet counts. It compares best lab values to predefined thresholds. It computes two sets of best lab values as outlined on page 9 of the toolkit: one for community-onset AOD using baseline values from the entire hospitalization, and another for hospital-onset AOD using baseline values specific to BCWP. 

### `define_ase`
This is the main function users will interact with in the package. By invoking `define_ase`, users automatically trigger the sub-functions listed above and helper functions to sequentially evaluate the ASE toolkit criteria. This function contains parameters for lab measurement thresholds of creatinine, bilirubin, lactate, and platelet counts, as well as the minimum duration of qualifying antimicrobial treatment days. These parameters are preset to align with the ASE toolkit’s criteria but can be customized to align with specific research needs. Additionally, the function includes parameters such as `cohort_id` and `transferout_id`, which allow users to select subgroups and indicate patients who were transferred out to an acute hospital. 

### Parameters of `define_ase`

| Parameter Name     | Description                                               | 
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `daily_data`    | A data frame containing daily patient data with columns `unique_pt_id`, `seqnum`, `day`, `death`, `ALL_DAYS`, and other clinical variables. |
| `transferout_id`   | A vector of sequence numbers (`seqnum`) indicating patients who were transferred out to an acute hospital (default is NULL). |
| `cohort_id`        | A list of two vectors: patient IDs (`unique_pt_id`) and sequence numbers (`seqnum`) for sub-group selection. |
| `abx_days`         | Required number of consecutive antimicrobial days (default is 4 in the absence of death, transfer, or discharge, per the ASE toolkit). |
| `window`           | The number of calendar days on either side of blood culture collection. Must be an integer between 1 and 4 (default is 2, per the ASE toolkit) |
| `creat_hi_lo_ratio`| The ratio of high to low creatinine levels to define renal dysfunction (default is 2, per the ASE toolkit). |
| `creat_hi_cutoff`  | The cutoff value for high creatinine levels (default is 44 µmol/L, default is 44 µmol/L, per the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage (RIFLE) renal disease classification system guidelines). |
| `tbili_hi_cutoff`  | The cutoff value for high bilirubin levels (default is 34.2 µmol/L, per the ASE toolkit). |
| `tbili_hi_lo_ratio`| The ratio of high to low bilirubin levels to define liver dysfunction (default is 2, per the ASE toolkit). |
| `lact_hi_cutoff`   | The cutoff value for high lactate levels (default is 2 mmol/L, per the ASE toolkit). |
| `plt_lo_cutoff`    | The cutoff value for low platelet counts (default is 100 10^9/L, per the ASE toolkit). |
| `plt_lo_hi_ratio`  | The ratio of low to high platelet counts to define hematologic dysfunction (default is 0.5, per the ASE toolkit). |

## Example

```{r}
# Get the path to the example data file inside the package
data_path <- system.file("extdata", "example_input_data", 
                         "daily_data.csv", package = "identifyASE")

# Read the data 
daily_data <- read.csv(data_path)

# Use `transferout_id` to indicate `seqnum` of patients who were transferred 
# out to an acute hospital
transferout_id <- c(12602,54928,27201)

# Use `cohort_id` to select a subgroup by including 2 vectors: 
# The first vector contains patient IDs (`unique_pt_id`)  
# The second vector contains sequence numbers (`seqnum`)

cohort_id <- list(c(1, 2), c(12602, 18613))

# Identify Adult Sepsis Events
result <- define_ase(daily_data = daily_data, 
										 transferout_id = transferout_id, 
										 cohort_id = cohort_id,
										 window = 2,
										 abx_days = 4,
										 creat_hi_lo_ratio = 2,
										 creat_hi_cutoff = 44,
										 tbili_hi_cutoff = 34.2,
										 tbili_hi_lo_ratio = 2,
										 lact_hi_cutoff = 2,
										 plt_lo_cutoff = 100,
										 plt_lo_hi_ratio = 0.5)
```

## Results

The output returned by the main function `define_ase` corresponds to the selected BCWP (1-day, 2-day, 3-day or 4-day). It includes a list of unique hospitalization identifiers where the identified ASE cases occurred. It also provides separate lists of unique hospitalization identifiers categorized by sepsis onset type (community-onset vs. hospital-onset). The output also includes the data surrounding the blood culture events, with additional variables such as indicators for qualifying antimicrobial treatments, the presence of various types of acute organ dysfunctions, and indicators for sepsis onset types, which can be used for subsequent reporting.  

To view the full output: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(result)
```

The structure of the output is a list with multiple nested levels, with the top-level keys "IDs", "Data_(x)days". 

1. *"IDs"* stores patient sequence numbers categorized by these sub-keys: 
 
- $community-onset: community-onset ASE cases
- $hospital-onset: hospital-onset ASE cases
- $all_ase: all ASE cases

Example: 

- $IDs\$community-onset: Includes a list of sequence numbers for community-onset ASE cases in the specified window. 

To export the IDs lists to csv files, use the following code: 
	
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ids_list <- result[["IDs"]] 
invisible(
  # Iterate over the single-layer list
  lapply(names(ids_list), function(id_name) {
    # Extract the data (sequence numbers) for the current id_name
    data <- ids_list[[id_name]]
    
    # Convert the data to a data frame
    data_df <- data.frame(seqnum = data)
    
    # Define the output file name
    file_name <- paste0("IDs_", id_name, ".csv")
    
    # Export to CSV
    write.csv(data_df, file_name, row.names = FALSE)
    
    # Print confirmation message
    cat("Exported:", file_name, "\n")
  })
)
```

2. *"Data_(x)days"* includes data of ASE cases surrounding the selected (x) window (1-day,2-day, 3-day or 4-day). For example, if window = 2,  the output will include the dataset "Data_2days". If window = 3,  the output will include the dataset "Data_3days". The following variables are added to the dataset:

- **Antimicrobial Qualification**
	- `abx_qualifying`: Indicates whether the antimicrobial treatment qualifies based on the toolkit criteria.
	- `abx_qualifying_ep`: Indicates whether this patient episode contains any qualifying antimicrobial treatment.

- **Acute Organ Dysfunction (AOD)** 
	- `aod_cv_daily`, `aod_imv_daily`, `aod_lactate_daily`, `aod_liver_daily`, `aod_renal_daily`, `aod_heme_daily`: binary daily indicators for specific types of acute organ dysfunction. These AOD variables are derived using criteria outlined in the ASE Toolkit (pages 5 and 22).
	- `aod_any_daily_comm`, `aod_any_daily_hosp`: binary daily indicators for community vs. hospital onset AOD.

- **Sepsis Onset Type**
	- `sepsis_com_v2`: Binary indicator for community-onset ASE.
	- `sepsis_hosp_v2`: Binary indicator for hospital-onset ASE. 

To export the data to csv file, use the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Export Data_2days to a csv file
write.csv(result$Data_2days, "Data_2days.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Searching Data by Sequence Number with `search_by_seqnum`

The function `search_by_seqnum` is designed to assist subsequent analysis. It allows users to search through a list of sliced BCWP data and retrieve the data slices that match a specified sequence number.

### Example

```{r}
# Example sliced_data_list
sliced_data_list <- list(
  list(unique_pt_id = 1, seqnum = 12602, data = data.frame(day = 1:3, 
                                                       bcx_daily = c(0, 1, 0))),
  list(unique_pt_id = 2, seqnum = 18613, data = data.frame(day = 1:3, 
                                                       bcx_daily = c(0, 1, 0)))
)

# Call the function to search for sequence number 12602
search_by_seqnum(sliced_data_list, 12602)
```
